# hello-world
my first repo learning how to use Github and Git!

Hi All,

I am pursuing my new passion for Java Development after an interesting sales career!
This will primarily be a place to showcase what I can do and to collaborate with others.

I am working hard to learn and will soon be adding my own work to show you what I can do! If by any chance you are reading this and are looking for an entry level Java Developer for your London team have a look at what I can do - I may be the creative junior you are looking for!
